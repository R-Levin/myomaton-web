# MioPages development control and continuity

Status: **proposed continuity checkpoint — not yet merged**. Recorded 2026-11-01.
This file is the first-read **navigation and operational handoff** when merged to `main`. It does not supersede source code, immutable database state, approved product contracts or live provider evidence. Do not claim current runtime/database state from Git alone.

## Mandatory start-of-chat protocol

1. Read this document **from GitHub's current `main`**, not a remembered excerpt or a stale local copy. If it is absent, inaccessible or conflicts with another source, **stop before hosted writes** and explicitly report the gap.
2. Check current `main` SHA and compare to the last recorded checkpoint below. Check the relevant 20i/local checkout separately before running commands; a local `origin/main` can be stale without `git fetch`. Do not presume a clean checkout, running process, successful credential setup, or current database contents.
3. Read the linked operator/architecture contracts and any more recent committed evidence. Classify every operational fact as **live verified**, **reported historical proof**, **planned**, or **unknown**. Current database truth requires authorized direct read-only verification.
4. State the **exact next bounded operation**, prerequisites, scope, expected success, failure/unknown-outcome stop rules and whether it mutates live state. Never replay a previous bootstrap, role provision, migration or initializer to recover context.
5. Read the Commercial V1 roadmap below **at every phase exit**. Completing infrastructure never implies that MioPages commercial V1 is complete.
6. After each material operation, checkpoint a sanitized evidence record in Git (or explicitly report why not possible). The handoff is incomplete until the record is retrievable through GitHub. Do not place credentials, tokens, database URLs, private business/customer details, raw query results or sensitive logs into Git.
7. At a new-chat boundary: **fetch this file afresh, verify SHA and cite the next action**. If the file cannot be retrieved, say so immediately rather than relying on chat memory. This process is a verifiable retrieval requirement, not an assertion that ChatGPT automatically opens files.

## Current source and hosted boundary (2026-11-01)

- Repository: `R-Levin/myomaton-web`; branch `main`.
- Source checkpoint: `b3722dd37045e8e200ba0aff8ceff2e201a5e228` — **Add fresh hosted C0 initialization and hostname binding**. At time of recording GitHub `main` pointed to this SHA. User-provided 20i shell output showed `HEAD` at this SHA, synchronized `main...origin/main` and a clean tracked tree after a fast-forward pull. **Future sessions must recheck.**
- 20i hostname: `runtime.miopages.com`. User reported Node 22.23.2 and installed dependencies. Earlier recovery says 20i Application Manager supervises the runtime on port 8080 with `shared-hostnames` routing. The last known-host 404 was the expected unbound tenant state, **not** an application failure.
- Provider/database historical proof (from the uploaded latest `runtime-content/chat-recovery.md`, 2026-11-01): Supabase PostgreSQL 17 (previously 17.11), session pooler 5432, verified TLS `sslmode=verify-full`, ICU identity validated, 16 migrations applied/zero pending, valid PG17 compatibility receipt. Three permanent dedicated roles `miopages_runtime`, `miopages_migration`, `miopages_backup` were **already created and independently verified**. These are reported earlier hosted results, **not fresh database inspection in this documentation task**.
- The latest recovery note reports hosted customer/operational application inventory empty, including **zero** Organization, Web Presence, Managed Site, Page, Section and hostname-binding rows. The historical nine-migration C0 initializer refused safely; **do not use it or try repair/reset**.
- The new protected fresh-hosted operator and separate generic hostname operator are committed and locally tested. Native local PG17 integrations were partially skipped owing to missing binaries; do not count skipped tests as passing. No fresh hosted C0 create or hostname bind has occurred in the current chat.
- In the current conversation, three nonsecret role environment variables were set in an interactive 20i shell. `DATABASE_URL` and `MIOPAGES_DATABASE_NAME` were **unset at that moment**. A separate ignored 20i note `runtime-content/hosted-provisioning-recovery.md` was created; it is supplementary, not a source-of-truth replacement. No hosted writes were made. The operator connection has **not** been established.
- **Current operational decision: PAUSED for continuity repair.** This proposed documentation change does not authorize hosted database writes. Resume only after a deliberate review of current source, connection procedure and live prerequisites.

## Guarded next hosted sequence (after pause is lifted)

Authoritative procedure: [C0 canonical state / fresh-hosted synthetic establishment](miopages-c0-canonical-state.md#fresh-hosted-synthetic-establishment).

1. Confirm clean/current 20i checkout and read the exact operator contract.
2. Establish protected `miopages_migration` operator credentials **separately** from persistent `miopages_runtime` app credentials. Obtain actual endpoint and certificate paths from protected existing configuration, never guessed values; require verified TLS and expected database/role identity. Do not overwrite persistent runtime configuration.
3. Run protected fresh-hosted C0 `create` **once**, stop on unexpected failure; a disconnect around COMMIT is an unknown outcome requiring independent read-only verification before any deliberate retry.
4. Independently run fresh-hosted C0 `verify` (read-only). Only then bind `runtime.miopages.com` to reviewed Web Presence `926cb772-7507-4542-8acd-e7e57ce71324` and Managed Site `312b8081-4582-47fa-bedb-a551fd6e2b36` via the dedicated managed-hostname operator. Independently verify.
5. Clear temporary migration/operator credentials. Verify bound Host responds with the expected rendered Managed Site (200); unknown Host still refuses (404); validate public HTTPS separately. The existing normal runtime renderer supplies the HTML—**a stub page is neither needed nor equivalent to a tenant-routing proof**.
6. Do not equate technical routing with commercial publication or customer approval. Follow with separately scoped hosted C1 isolation, restart, deployment/rollback, persistent assets, independent recovery/off-provider backup, monitoring and capacity proofs. Do not rerun fresh C0 initialization after binding: the initializer deliberately refuses later operational inventory.

**Explicit prohibitions:** no bootstrap/migration/role-provision replay; no historical initializer; no broadening runtime permissions; no `postgres` as production application runtime; no arbitrary SQL repair, credential disclosure, silent retry, live-customer data or commercial launch inference.

**Synthetic meaning:** hosted C0 is a controlled synthetic tenant **using the reviewed MioPages C0 manifest and fixed IDs**. It is not a real paying customer. Its initial hosted graph is recorded as **4 Pages / 19 Sections**. The later reviewed canonical visual/content direction describes **4 Pages / 23 Sections**; these are distinct stages and must not be conflated. Public access after hostname binding is a separate exposure decision.

## Proof/evidence ledger (nonsecret)

| Boundary | Current classification | Evidence or qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source/operator implementation | GitHub verified at checkpoint | Commit `b3722dd`; [C0 operator procedure](miopages-c0-canonical-state.md) |
| 20i Git checkout | User live shell output, 2026-11-01 | Clean `main...origin/main`, HEAD `b3722dd` after `git pull --ff-only` |
| Hosted 20i runtime | Historical reported proof | Application Manager, port 8080, expected unknown Host 404 |
| Hosted PG17 TLS/migrations/roles | Historical reported proof | 16/0, verified TLS, permanent three roles; fresh read-only check pending |
| Hosted customer rows before next write | Historical reported empty | No fresh inspection in this continuity task |
| Protected migration operator connection | Not established | All five operator variables initially unset; only three nonsecret roles set |
| Fresh hosted C0 create/verify | Not attempted | Requires separate scoped execution |
| Hostname bind/verify | Not attempted | Requires verified C0 |
| Bound public HTTPS known-host 200 | Not verified | Known-host 404 before binding is expected |
| Hosted C1 isolation / backup / restart / deploy / monitoring / scale | Not proven | Must remain explicit hosted gate |

Never promote historical evidence to live without an actual check. Add new evidence here or in a reviewed linked committed ledger after each operational boundary, with date, SHA, environment, action, sanitized outcome and any unknowns.

## Return path: full MioPages Commercial V1

The canonical roadmap remains [Platform/service architecture — Commercial V1 sequence](platform-service-architecture.md#commercial-v1-scope-and-development-sequence) and outstanding gates remain in [deferred architecture](deferred-architecture.md). There is **no second independent backlog**.

1. Hosted foundation: 20i + PostgreSQL + independent backup proof, C0/C1 routing, persistent media, restart/deploy/recovery, monitoring, scaling observations. **Active gate.**
2. Production authority: authenticated operator, scoped production operations and tenant boundaries.
3. Commercial intake and near-finished AI-assisted site generation from confirmed structured business knowledge, with operator QA, copy/SEO/media preparation.
4. Minimal customer portal, including onboarding, review/approval, status/reporting and supported HostShop handoff.
5. Safe authorized publication, Contact/leads and conversion delivery.
6. First-party measurement, Performance Snapshot, improvement proposals, approved release and remeasurement.
7. End-to-end Commercial V1 rehearsal.
8. Real MioPages C0, then Customer #1 after readiness gates.

The approved Free Review Draft D Revision 3 remains approved **but undelivered** according to the latest recovery record; it is not a go-live or publication authorization. The future WordPress deployment/plugin path is explicitly **post-V1**.

**Phase-exit rule:** when hosted foundation is accepted against its evidence, do not keep inventing infrastructure work. Open the canonical roadmap, record completed gates and move to the next applicable stage. Exceptions require explicit priority rationale and revised checkpoint.

## Sources, scope and maintenance

- [Architecture and Human/ChatGPT/Codex responsibility](platform-service-architecture.md)
- [Shared hostname routing](shared-hostname-routing.md)
- [Managed PostgreSQL recovery/role contract](managed-postgres-recovery.md)
- [C0 operator commands/IDs](miopages-c0-canonical-state.md)
- [Deferred architecture / actual open readiness gates](deferred-architecture.md)
- Historical detailed handoff: ignored local `runtime-content/chat-recovery.md`, user-uploaded on 2026-11-01. This file **was read in its actual latest form** during continuity repair. It is not fetched by Git and must not be assumed available in later chats. Git control now carries the critical current state/next-boundary facts.
- Live secrets/credentials/runtime config stay outside Git. The checked-in operations record must contain only nonsecret context.
- After review/merge, modify the README to link this as the **mandatory current-status entry point**, and correct any stale 'external provisioning has not begun' summary. Do not silently rewrite historical proofs; mark them historical.
- Before declaring this handoff reliable, test it from a separate read of GitHub `main`, checking the commit/status/next boundary/Commercial V1 route without local recovery-file access. Until merged and tested, **continuity fix remains incomplete**.
